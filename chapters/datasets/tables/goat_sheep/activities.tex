			Lying             & The animal is lying on the ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\
			Standing          & The animal is standing still, occasionally moving its head or stepping very slowly.                                                                                                                                                     \\
			Grazing          & The animal is eating fresh grass, hay from a pile or twigs on the ground.                                                                                                                                                              \\
			Fighting          & The animal is fighting with another animal. This consists of banging its head against another animal's head or body. A goat often stands on the back of its legs, drops itself to the ground and drives its horns into another animal. \\
			Shaking           & The animal is shaking its entire body in a very rapid motion, often followed by rapidly shaking its head for a brief moment. On a few occasions, the animal only shakes its head.                                                        \\
			Scratch-Biting    & The animal is using its teeth to nibble on its own skin. Sometimes the animal uses its hoofs.                                                                                                                   \\
			Walking          & The animal is walking. The pace of walking varies from very slowly to nearly trotting.                                                                                                                                                      \\
			Trotting          & This is the phase between walking and running. The animal is not galloping rapidly but walking very quickly and is therefore in a trot state.                                                                                                      \\
			Running           & The animal is galloping.                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\ \bottomrule
