			\textbf{Activity} & \textbf{Description} \\ \midrule
			Standing  & The animal is standing still, occasionally moving its head or stepping very slowly.\\
			Lying   & Lying on the ground, occasionally moving its head \\
			Eating      & Eating hay from a pile or twigs/grains on the ground. \\
			Grazing    & The animal is pulling fresh grass out of the ground and eating it. \\
			Walking     & The animal is walking. The pace of walking varies from very slowly to nearly trotting.\\
			Trotting    & This is the phase between walking and running. The animal is not galloping rapidly but walking very quickly and is therefore in a trot state.\\
			Running     & The animal gallops.\\ 
			Fighting    & The animal is fighting with another animal. This consists of banging its head against another animal's head or body. A goat often stands on the back of its legs, drops itself to the ground and drives its horns into another animal. \\
			Shaking     & The animal is shaking its entire body in a very rapid motion, often followed by rapidly shaking its head for a brief moment. On a few occasions, the animal only shakes its head.\\
			Climbing up & The animal is walking/jumping up onto an object. For example climbing into a shelter, or jumping onto a wooden bench.\\
			Climbing down & The animal is walking/jumping down from an object. For example climbing out of a shelter, or jumping off a wooden bench.\\
			Rubbing     & The goat is pressing its body against a fence and walking while it keeps pushing itself towards the fence.\\
			Scratch-Biting    & The animal is using its teeth to nibble on its own skin. Sometimes the animal uses its hoofs. \\
			Breast-Feeding & Standing still and allowing her kids to drink milk. \\
			Standing-Up & Standing upright against an object (usually fence), with hind hoofs on the ground. \\
			Food fight  & This occurs when food is dropped in a group of animals. All animals are pushing each other trying to reach the food.\\
