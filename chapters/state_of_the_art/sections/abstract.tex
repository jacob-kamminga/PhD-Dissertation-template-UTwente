In this chapter, we introduce the process of \gls{aar} and discuss the state of the art.
We describe each of the steps involved with \gls{aar} starting with data acquisition and finishing with training and evaluation of \gls{aar} classifiers.

In the second part of this chapter we present a comparative survey of the state of the art in \gls{aar}.
We compare properties such as dataset size and composition, number and type of discriminated activities, sensors, features, and classifiers.
We show that there is a need for open access datasets that contain data from multiple subjects.
Generic performance of classifiers has not been studied sufficiently so far.
Furthermore, multiple studies reported varying sensor orientations during data acquisition while sensor-orientation-independent \gls{aar} has not yet been studied.
