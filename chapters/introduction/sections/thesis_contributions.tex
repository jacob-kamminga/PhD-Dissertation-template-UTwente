\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:intro_contributions}

Considering the aforementioned research objective, questions, and hypotheses we sum up the research contributions of this thesis below.

\contribution[\acrlong{aar} survey]

In \chaptername~\ref{chapter:state_of_the_art}, we conduct a literature study that positions the work presented in this thesis in terms of the state of the art.
We compare the existing work in \gls{aar} and discuss the open research challenges.
We compare the following factors in \gls{aar} research: the number of subjects used in the study, number and type of activities to be recognized, used features, sensor modalities, orientation-independence, classifier type, evaluation method, and performance.
	

\contribution[Sensor-Video Synchronization and Labeling Tool]

To answer \rqname~\ref{rq:labeling}, we discuss a synchronization method to synchronize videos with sensor data.
The method has been used to develop a labeling application that is described in \chaptername~\ref{chapter:data_aquisition_and_labeling}.
Annotations (labels) can be added to the data, and the produced labeled dataset can be exported.
The research and labeling tool have appeared in~\cite{Kamminga_2019_DATA_labeling_sync, Matlab_labeling_github}:
