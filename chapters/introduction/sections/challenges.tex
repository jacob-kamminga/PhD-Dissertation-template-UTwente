\section{Challenges and Requirements}
\label{sec:intro_challenges}

Monitoring and activity recognition of livestock and wildlife using collar tags is challenging for several reasons. 
In this section, we list the challenges of \gls{aar} along with essential requirements.


\subsection{Resource Constraints}
\label{challenges:resource}
\gls{aar} systems that utilize sensors located on or near animals must consider ethical and legal implications.
The accepted collar-to-subject weight ratio depends on the size of the animal, and the used weights in the literature vary from \SI{0.7}{\%} to \SI{9}{\%} of body mass, where smaller animals generally carry a greater proportional collar weight~\cite{Brooks2008, Andrusiak1998}.
