\section{Thesis Organization}
\label{sec:intro_thesis_organization}

In this chapter, we have discussed \acrfull{aar}, \acrfull{ml}, and the challenges that accompany them.
Based on these challenges, we presented our research objectives, questions, and hypotheses.
\figurename~\ref{fig:intro_thesis_organization} shows a diagram of the thesis organization and provides an outline for the remainder of this thesis.
\chaptername~\ref{chapter:state_of_the_art} introduces the process of \gls{aar}, its intermediate steps, and a survey of the state of the art.
In \chaptername~\ref{chapter:data_aquisition_and_labeling}, we present three datasets that were collected and used for the research discussed in the subsequent chapters.
Furthermore, we discuss the challenges found in data labeling and our approach to overcome them.
\tablename~\ref{tab:dataset_usage_disseration} shows an overview of the dataset usage throughout the thesis.
