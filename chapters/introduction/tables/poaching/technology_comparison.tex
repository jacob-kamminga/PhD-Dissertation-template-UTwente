\midrule
Radar & Longer range; does not require direct line of sight; estimate velocity of target; tracking~of~target & No stealth due to active nature; sensitive to interference, such as precipitation and foliage; intruders can reduce radar signature; expensive & \citep{Inomata2004,Neumann2007,Caris,Essen2012,Harman2005,Arora2004,bumblebee_web,He2014,Butler2007,Tuinstra2011} \\
Magnetic & Detection of metal objects such as cars or weapons & Very short range & \citep{Kim2008, He2004, He2006, Arora2004} \\
Acoustic & Long range; economical   & Different acoustic characteristics found in different environments; large vocal repertoire & \citep{Jumnani2014, Zeppelzauer2015, Langbauer1991, Kim2008} \\
Ultrasonic & Long range; economical & Ultrasonic sound is easily absorbed by clothing and foliage & \citep{Petersen2002} \\
Optical & Long range; identification of targets & Require line of sight; expensive  & \citep{Kim2008,Aseeri2014,ProjectRAPID,Mishra2010,Mulero-Pazmany2014,Zhang2014,air_shepherd,Sun2011} \\
Infrared and Thermal & Possibility to detect target at night & Difficult to detect target in hot environments & \citep{Rothenpieler2009,Mulero-Pazmany2014,Zhang2014,Cambron2015} \\
Radio Frequency & Does not require line of sight; high level of~stealth & Require (buried) cables along perimeter; limited volumetric range & \citep{harman1976guidar,Poirier1982,Harman2005, Inomata2014,Inomata2006,Senstar2011} \\
Motion & Possibility to classify intrusion type on fences or structures; economical & Range limited to physical structure that sensors are attached to & \citep{Cambron2015,Wittenburg2007,Yousefi2008,Stellar,Maki2007,Maki1998,Microwave,Backx2002} \\
Seismic & High level of~stealth & Range and quality of seismic measurements is different for each environment (soil type) & \citep{Tuinstra2011,Sun2011,Kim2008} \\
Chemical & Can be used to mark targets for identification; tracking of poached items & Does not prevent animals from being killed; can be obtrusive to animals & \citep{Zhou2012,Petersen2002,SouthAfrican,AndersonBradleyandJooste2014,Milliken,Mukwazvure2014} \\
Animal Sentinels & In theory very large volumetric range; high~sensitivity  & Many sensors needed; deployment difficulties such as power usage and collaring & \citep{Sahin2007,FirmatBanzi2014,Recio2011,Petersen2002} \\
